# Working with Exception Handling and Pickling in Python (Assignment 7)
*SNunn,2020-05-29*
## Introduction
In this assignment, we modify the code from Assignment 06 into Assignment 07, so that it stores the ToDoFile as a .dat binary file (pickling).  We also add some advanced Exception Handling to handle scenarios where the .dat file is missing or not setup properly.
Part of this assignment was researching websites which would help us with Exception Handling and Picking.  Below were the useful websites I found, and why I found them useful.
Useful website for learning about Exception Handling:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/438894/how-do-i-stop-a-program-when-an-exception-is-raised-in-python
The website above was useful in learning how to exit the program after the exception was raised.  First, we import “sys”, then we use sys.exit() in the appropriate place.
Useful websites for learning about Pickling:

The website above was useful in learning more about the advantages of using the Pickle Module, specifically: Recursive Objects, Object Sharing, and User-defined classes.
